# Reactv19 + Vite Template

This is a project template created using

    `npm create vite@latest vite-react-project-template -- --template react`

All the boiler-plate code provided by React is removed so that you can build your project from scratch.

Note : Change the `project-name` in package.json to the current project you are working on
