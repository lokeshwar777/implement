 * throttling
 * update content without reload -> AJAX -> fetch for API call
 * when js is executed -> all files are combined -> 1 global window object is created
 * modules
 * js -> interpreted+compiled language
 * huge manual documentation -> HTML
 * wayback machine -> old websites
 * readymade libraries are injurious to skills
 * var - global/function scope
 * let,const - block scope
 * undefined - default value
