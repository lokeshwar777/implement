# Reactv19 + Vite + Tailwindv4 Template

This is a project template created using

    `npm create vite@latest vite-react-tailwindv4-project-template -- --template react`

All the boiler-plate code provided by React is removed so that you can build your project from scratch.

Tailwind v4 configuration is also added to it, you can directly work on the project and use tailwind styles comfortably without worrying about the configurations.

[Prettier plugin for Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted) is also configured as a dev dependency to ensure auto sorting of classes.

Note : Change the `project-name` in package.json to the current project you are working on
